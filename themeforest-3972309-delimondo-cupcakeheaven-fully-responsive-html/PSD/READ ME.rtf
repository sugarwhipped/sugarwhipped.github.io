Due to the massive amount of Photoshop Data, i had to put all the screens in one document. To get the best controll oaver the screens, i have setup with photoshop owns Layer Compositions. You will find this feature under the menu windows in photoshop. Open up the layer palette "layer compositions" and simply click the composition in which youre interested in. You also can use the normal layer palette, but for best possible results please use the layer composition palette. If you run in any kind of trouble pleade dont hesitate and contact me via marcos@templaterockers.com.
